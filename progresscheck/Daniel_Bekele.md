        - Installing chasten and running it.
        - Installing Mutmut
        - Looking for examplery project to use. Confirming that python, poetry, pytest, chasten, and mutmut (likely these tools, not guaranteed) work for each of the subjects. Documenting the steps needed to get the subjects to work with each of these tools; perhaps simply editing the README.md for each project is sufficient

# Weekly Progress Checks

## Week 4

Week 4 goals: 

* Install all of the tools that we will use for this empirical study (e.g., python, poetry, pytest, chasten and mutmut although this might change)

* Find at least 3 to 5 subjects and fork them into the AstuteSource organization. Then, complete the following steps for each subject:

--> Confirming that python, poetry, pytest, chasten, and mutmut (likely these tools, not guaranteed) work for each of the subjects

--> Document the steps needed to get the subjects to work with each of these tools; perhaps simply editing the README.md for each project is sufficient?

* Pick a name for the tool that we are going to build and then create a repository for it in the AstuteSource organization

* Make sure that you are a owner/maintainer of the AstuteSource organization and the repositories inside of it

* Divide up the implementation tasks from the whiteboard pictures for the main tool that we are going to implement

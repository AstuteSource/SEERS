# Week 1

## Goals
- Install all of the tools that we will use for this empirical study (e.g., python, poetry, pytest, chasten and mutmut although this might change)
- Find at least 3 to 5 subjects and fork them into the AstuteSource organization. Then, complete the following steps for each subject:
- Pick a name for the tool that we are going to build and then create a repository for it in the AstuteSource organization
- Make sure that you are a owner/maintainer of the AstuteSource organization and the repositories inside of it
- Divide up the implementation tasks from the whiteboard pictures for the main tool that we are going to implement

## Log

- Ensured that all needed programming tools were installed.
- Ran development tools on example python project of [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry).

## üéâ Introduction

**Comma** is a custom tool developed as part of the Junior Seminar Research group project [SEERS](https://github.com/AstuteSource/SEERS/tree/main), focusing on the topic of empirically studying the relationship between code quality anti-patterns and mutation scores for Python projects.

**Comma** is designed to execute static analysis tools, notably [Chasten](https://github.com/AstuteSource/chasten/tree/master), and the mutation tool [Mutmut](https://github.com/boxed/mutmut) on selected subject programs. It identifies specific anti-patterns associated with low code quality, as collected from [Zhu et al.(2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121220302545), and correlates them with mutation scores at the function level. Comma overcomes the limitation of per-line mutants returned by Mutmut by parsing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of programs. Additionally, it unifies the output data from Chasten and Mutmut into a cohesive dataset, facilitating further analysis.
Comma aims to train and evaluate machine learning models to predict mutation scores based on code quality anti-patterns.

## üîãFeatures

* ‚ú® Granular analysis of Python programs' abstract syntax trees (AST) for code quality anti-patterns
* üìä Correlation of detected anti-patterns with mutation scores at the function level
* üîÑ Unification of output data from static analysis and mutation testing tools into a cohesive dataset
* üîÄ Seamless integration of result files from multiple runs of the tool for comprehensive analysis

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.11
- [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich): Full-featured formatting and display of text in the terminal
- [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry): Packaging and dependency management

## üîΩ Installation

Follow these steps to install the `chasten` program:

- Install Python 3.11 for your operating system
- Clone this repository:  `git@github.com:AstuteSource/SEERS.git`

## ‚ú® Analysis

To analyze code using Comma:

1. Place the desired projects to test in the `demo` folder. Navigate into the `demo` folder in a terminal and use `git clone` to clone the desired project repositories.

2. Return to the `analyzer` folder and run the following command to install dependencies using Poetry `poetry install`

3. Once the installation is complete, execute the following command to run the analysis:

```bash
poetry run analyzer --search-path demo --save-directory subject-data --chasten-config-path Config

```

Replace the options --search-path, --save-directory, and --chasten-config-path with the desired paths where the project will be searched, files will be saved, and configuration files will be located, respectively. These should be Path objects passed in a manner similar to the example command provided above.

- Once the analysis and unfication complete, the following message will pop up

```script
Code analysis and mutation complete!
Result is stored in file named combined_result.json
üßπ Final sweeping, saved to new_output_with_functions.json
```

The complete data exists in `new_output_with_functions.json`

- Now, you can scan the ouput to confirm that, for instance, the mutation score for pattern named `add_files` that was inserted 3 mutants (01 survived, 02 killed) has a mutation score of 0.3333333333333333.

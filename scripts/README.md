# Scripts

This directory serves as the public workspace for creating scripts.

The goal of this directory is to create a script that can run the checks and collect patterns into a json file (ex. Run chasten for each program and save the output. Then run the mutation analysis, save it, and run our script to parse the files and convert it into a json file/an output)

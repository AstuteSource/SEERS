# üß¨ Comma

## üéâ Introduction

This tool is made for the Junior Seminar Research group project [SEERS](https://github.com/AstuteSource/SEERS/tree/main) for the topic **Empirically Studying the Relationship between Code Quality Anti-Patterns and Mutation Score for Python Projects**

`TODO: shorten this paragraph to focus on the main overview of the tool`
A custom program, referred to as analyzer, was developed within SEERS, to execute static analysis tools, notably Chasten and mutation tool Mutmut on the selected subject programs (we tested this program significantly on lazytracker). The analyzer program scanned the source code segments for specific anti-patterns known for their association with low code quality, collected from Zhu et al.(2021). Subsequently, it parsed the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the programs to correlate detected anti-patterns within the scope of individual functions. Additionally, the analyzer program scanned thorugh the mutants generated by Mutmut, correlating them within the function scope extracted from the AST.This approach enabled a more granualar analysis of mutation scores at the function level, overcoming the limitation of per-line mutants returned by Mutmut. Following the execution of the analyzer program, the output data from Chasten and Mutmut was structured and unified into a cohesive dataset. This unified dataset, organized in a "tidy data format", included all relevant mata values essential for improving the accuracy of subsequent machine learning models.Each entry in the dataset was associated with a specific function within the subject program, and correlating mutants inserted in the function. The program then collecting failure mutants to return mutation score, per the methodology stated in the Harman et al. (2011) paper. While the statistical correlation provided initial insights, the subsequent step involved training and evaluating maching learning models to predict mutation scores based on code quality anti-patterns

## üîãFeatures

`TODO: extract features from the tool overview`

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.11
- [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich): Full-featured formatting and display of text in the terminal
- The developers of Comma use [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) for packaging and dependency management

## üîΩ Installation

Follow these steps to install the `chasten` program:

- Install Python 3.11 for your operating system
- Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:AstuteSource/SEERS.git`

## ‚ú® Analysis

`TODO: reword the artifact`

- The `analyzer` folder currently contains our project.In order to run it, put desired projects to test on in the `demo` folder.
This can be done by navigating into the `demo` folder in a terminal and
running `git clone` for desired project repositories.

- Then, return to the `analyzer` folder and run `poetry install`.

- Once this is complete, the user can run `poetry run analyzer`, with optional parameters
for which path will be searched for a project, where the files will be saved, and where
the desired config files are. These are all `Path` objects, which can be passed in in a
manner resembling this command: 
`poetry run analyzer --search-path demo --save-directory subject-data --chasten-config-path Config`

- Once the analysis and unfication complete, the following message will pop up

```script
Code analysis and mutation complete!
Result is stored in file named combined_result.json
üßπ Final sweeping, saved to new_output_with_functions.json
```

The complete data exists in `new_output_with_functions.json`

- Now, you can scan the ouput to confirm that, for instance, the mutation score for pattern named `add_files` that was inserted 3 mutants (01 survived, 02 killed) has a mutation score of 0.3333333333333333.
